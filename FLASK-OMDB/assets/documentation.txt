FIRSTLY was created files app.py, extensions.py, tools.py and docker-compose.yml, then folders(assets, templates).
assets -> css, images, js, documentation.txt
templates -> base.html, index.html

SECOND STEP is deploying env by: py -m venv env, then importing libraries and installing them:
"pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-Migrate"

THIRD STEP making template from which other htmls will inherit in base.html, then in index.html constructing main page. (via bootstrap)
notes: 
<section>
class = "col-md-7"
class = "row"
class = "w-75" - width (/25/50/100)
text-primary
text-secondary
text-dark
text-muted
font-weight-bolder
class = "ms-5" (mt, mb, me)
class = "me-5" - margin end (right)
class = "fixed-top"
class = "border"

FOURTH STEP after connecting SQLAlchemy with some comms:
pip install mysql
flask db init - Create migrations folder
Then after creation model that is our table instance we migrate it by "flask db migrate" then "flask db upgrade"
Adding to table info -> flask shell -> from model import Class_Name -> variable = Class_Name('title' = 'smth', ....) -> db.session.add(variable) -> db.session.commit() or 
-> variable.save() (if save fucntion was created)
